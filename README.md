# Bank-Authentication-using-TensorFlow
Here we will try to classify banks as authentic or fraud through a Neural Network using Tensorflow

We will be using Bank Authentication Dataset from UCI Repository

The data consists of 5 columns:

variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

entropy of image (continuous)

class (integer)
Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.

This sort of task is perfectly suited for Neural Networks and Deep Learning!
